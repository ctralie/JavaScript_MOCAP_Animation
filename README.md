# JavaScript_MOCAP_Animation
Javascript parsing and stick figure browser animation for ASF/AMC MOCAP files. Final project for CS 290: 3D Digital Geometry at Duke University Spring 2016. 

Project contributers: Nina Sun, Brandon Choi, and Cosi Goldstein

To use:
Load an ASF and AMC file using the file chooser and click LOAD. Now the animation can be played with the PLAY, PAUSE, and RESET buttons. The camera position can also be changed to view the animation from different angles.

### Controls
A,S,D,W,E,C to move the camera

Click and drag to rotate

### Options

Use the "Show Bones" and "Show Joints" toggle to show/hide the bones and joints

### TODO
-Default framerate is set to 120 FPS in Scene.js. Add framerate option since some ASF/AMC files use 60 FPS as specified in database.

-Add capability to input MOCAP database link instead of uploading ASF/AMC files
